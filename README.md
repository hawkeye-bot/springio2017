# Artemis
The software in the labs runs based on an Artemis JMS server. Included in the repository is a standalone installation of Artemis 2.0.0. You can start it using the following steps:

1. Open a terminal in ${repository_home}/apache-artemis-2.0.0/springio/bin
2. Run `artemis run`

In case you need it, the username/password/role setup on the Artemis installation is _springio_
