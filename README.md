# Making the most of Spring Boot: adapting to your environment!
Welcome to the hands-on lab for Spring Boot. In this repository, there are a total of 5 branches available:
* master
* lab1
* lab2
* lab3
* solution

For this workshop, the lab-branches are incremental. This means that when you've finished lab1 (or you are stuck), you can simply checkout the next lab-branch to get a clean starting point for the next lab. As a result, the solution branch contains the total solution of all labs in this workshop.

The powerpoint that we'll be using during the workshop is available in all branches.

If you want to switch between labs, you can use the git checkout command:
* git checkout <master/lab1/lab2/lab3/solution>
