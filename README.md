# Making the most of Spring Boot: adapting to your environment!
Welcome to the hands-on lab for Spring Boot. In this repository, there are 2 branches available:
* master
* solution

The master branch contains the starting point for the hands-on lab. The solution branch contains
a solution/example of how to optimize the code.

## Artemis
The software in the labs runs based on an Artemis JMS server. Included in the repository is a standalone installation of Artemis 2.0.0. You can start it using the following steps:

1. Open a terminal in ${repository_home}/apache-artemis-2.0.0/springio/bin
2. Run `artemis run`

In case you need it, the username/password/role setup on the Artemis installation is _springio_
